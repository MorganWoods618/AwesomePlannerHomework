# AwesomePlannerHomework
This is a daily planner. We were given most of the HTML and CSS code to make this work. 
When upi open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar There are timeblocks for standard business hours and the color will change depending on the time of day. You can go in to the timeblock and enter an event, and click save. It will save that information to the local storage. When you click on Clear Planner, it clears the local storage.
